    Description:
      Abstract: 
        This map layer shows selected streamflow gaging stations of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the 
        U.S. Virgin Islands, in 2013.  Gaging stations, or gages, measure the height (stage) and volume of 
        flow at a point location on a water feature.  Gages in this map layer were drawn from the National 
        Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) Version 1 Stream Gage Events, NHDPlus Version 2 National 
        Data – Gage Locations, and from the National Water Information System (NWIS) Web Interface.  The 
        gage positions were adjusted (snapped) using ArcGIS so that the gages were located directly on 
        streams in the National Atlas map layer, 1:1,000,000-Scale Streams of the United States.  The gages 
        and streams also share attributes that link them together.

      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        The Gage_ID and Site_NO attributes were checked for duplicates and null values.  All features have 
        unique values.

        The values for Site_TP_CD, Lat_NWIS, Long_NWIS, Lat_1M, and Long_1M were checked to ensure that 
        there are no null values and that all values are in the correct domain.

        Values in the ReachCode field were checked to ensure that there are no null values.  They were 
        cross-checked with the Huc8 and Region values, and were checked against the ReachCode for the 
        corresponding stream in the National Atlas Streams 1:1,000,000-scale (1:1M) map layer.

        Values in the Stream_ID field were checked to ensure that there are no null values.  Stream_IDs 
        were also compared to Stream_IDs in the National Atlas Streams 1:1M map layer to ensure that 
        corresponding gages and streams have identical codes.

        Values in the Region and Huc8 fields were checked to ensure that there are no null values and all 
        values are in the correct domain.  Selections by attribute and location were used to ensure the 
        region code matches the region the gage is in.

        Values in the State and State_FIPS fields were checked to ensure that there are no null values and 
        all values are in the correct domain.  

        All remaining attribute fields were checked to ensure that there are no null values.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      Stream gage positions were checked against streams in the National Atlas Streams 1:1M 2014 map layer 
      to ensure that each gage has a corresponding 1:1M stream and no gage is associated with more than one 
      stream.
 
      Stream_IDs and ReachCodes were compared to Stream_IDs and ReachCodes in the National Atlas Streams 
      1:1M 2014 map layer to ensure that corresponding gages and streams have identical values.

      Stream gages downloaded from NWIS Web were compared to aerial imagery and topographic maps to ensure 
      they are located on the correct stream.

      Attributes were checked for nulls and valid values.

      Stream gages were checked to ensure that they are within national boundaries and coastlines.
    Completeness_Report:
      This map layer contains selected stream gages in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
      Islands.  Sites were selected only if they were within the terrestrial and coastal boundaries of the 
      U.S., they had a corresponding stream in the National Atlas Streams 1:1M map layer, they had one of 
      the following site types:
      > Canal
      > Ditch
      > Diversion
      > Estuary
      > Lake, Reservoir, Impoundment
      > Spring
      > Stream
      > Tidal Stream
      > Wetland
      >
      and they had daily values in the following list of parameters:
      > 00060 - Streamflow, ft/s
      > 00065 - Gage height, ft
      > 00054 - Reservoir storage, acre-ft
      > 00053 - Surface Area, acres
      > 00055 - Stream velocity, ft/s
      > 00059 - Streamflow rate, gal/min
      > 00062 - Reservoir elevation, ft
      > 50042 - Discharge, gallons per minute
      > 50051 - Flow rate, instantaneous, million gallons per day
      > 72022 - Reservoir contents, M/gal
      > 99020 - Elevation above NGVD 1929, ft
      > 99060 - Streamflow, m/s
      > 99065 - Gage height, m
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
          Most gages had their location reviewed during the creation of the NHDPlus version 1 and version 2 
          source data and therefore reflect the accuracy of those sources.  Gages from NWIS Web had their 
          location reviewed during the creation of this data set.  Gages were located on (snapped to) 
          streams in the National Atlas Streams 1:1M 2014 map layer.  The streams had been generalized, and 
          in some cases moved as much as 300 meters from nearby transportation features, so gages were 
          relocated along with their corresponding stream.

          Gages were obtained from the NHDPlus V1 Gages.  If the gage's reach code matched a reach code in 
          the National Atlas Streams 1:1M map layer then the gage was included and snapped to the nearest 
          point on the nearest stream.  The reach code of the gage was compared to the reach code of the 
          stream the gage snapped to.  If the codes were not identical then the station name for the gage 
          was compared to topographic map stream names to determine if the gage should be moved to a 
          different stream with a matching reach code or if the reach code for the gage should be 
          corrected.

          The NHDPlus V1 Gages were from 2004.  Additional gages were obtained from NWIS Web to supplement 
          the NHDPlus V1 Gages.  Gages were downloaded in February 2010, and gages with daily data in the

          Selection of Additional Gages and Streams

          Gages from the NWIS Web download were snapped to streams in the National Atlas Streams 1:1M.  If 
          the gage couldn't be snapped to a 1:1M stream, it was snapped to the NHDPlus V1 NHDFlowlines, or 
          in Alaska, to the High-Resolution NHDFlowlines.  Any gages that could not be snapped to one of 
          these three sources were deleted.  To determine if gages were snapped to the correct stream, the 
          station name was compared to stream names from National Atlas Streams 1:1M, NHDPlus V1 
          NHDFlowline, High-Resolution NHDFlowline, topographic maps, and aerial imagery.

          The 1:1M gages and streams were edited simultaneously.  Gages were used to determine if 
          additional streams should be added to the streams map layer, and streams were used to determine 
          if gages should be added in the gages map layer.  Gages were reviewed visually, using topographic 
          maps, aerial imagery, NHDPlus V1 NHDFlowlines, High-Resolution NHDFlowline, and National Atlas 
          Streams 1:1M.  Gages were not added to the map layer if adding their corresponding stream was 
          inconsistent with the density of streams in the area, if other gages on similar streams were 
          nearby, if the stream order was lower than other streams in the area, or if the gage was on a 
          canal.  At the same time, the stream was added to the National Atlas Streams 1:1M map layer.

          layer, they were snapped to the stream and added.  NHDPlus V2 Gages that did not have a matching 
          reach code in the streams were reviewed if their drainage area was greater than 100 square miles. 
          The station name for the gage was checked against topographic maps, imagery, and stream names to 
          determine if the gage should be moved to a different stream, have its reach code changed, and be 
          added to the gages map layer.

          Gages were intersected with National Atlas Streams 1:1M 2014 and each gage was assigned a measure 
          that corresponds to its location on a reach.  Measures range from 0 to 100 and record the 
          distance, as a percentage, from the downstream end of a reach.  If a reach is composed of more 
          than one stream segment, the measure is based on the length of the entire group of segments that 
          comprise the reach.  Measures are used in linear referencing.

          boundaries, the State abbreviations and FIPS codes were concatenated with a hyphen to include 
          information from multiple States.  Gages outside the boundaries of the States layer were removed.

              The gage is located at a facility where water is withdrawn or diverted from a stream or 
              waterbody.  Streamflow measurements at facility locations are expected to be strongly 
              influenced by current or previous human activity; diversion sites include points such as the 
              upstream end of a canal where it intersects a stream, the point where water is withdrawn from 
              a reservoir, and the point where water is pumped from a water body for use elsewhere.

        Attribute_Label: ReachCode
        Attribute_Definition: 
          A 14-digit, unique identifier for the reach where the gage is located.  A reach is a continuous 
          piece of surface water with similar hydrologic characteristics.  A reach may be composed of a 
          single feature, such as a lake or isolated stream, but reaches may also be composed of a number 
          of contiguous features.  The first eight digits of the code are the Watershed Boundary Dataset 
          Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC), which identifies the subbasin in which the water feature is located.  
          The next six digits are a randomly assigned, sequential number that is unique within the 
          subbasin.  Once assigned, a reach code is permanently associated with its reach.  

          The ReachCode links gages and other features to the 1:1,000,000-Scale Streams of the United 
          States, National Hydrography Dataset, National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 1, National 
          Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2, and other data sets that use reach codes.  No gage is 
          associated with more than one reach, however, there may be multiple gages on one reach.
