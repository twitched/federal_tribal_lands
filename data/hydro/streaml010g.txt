    Description:
      Abstract: 
        This map layer shows streams of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The 
        map layer was produced primarily from the Medium-Resolution and High-Resolution National 
        Hydrography Dataset NHDFlowline feature classes, through feature selection and cartographic 
        generalization based on reference to published small-scale ancillary data sets.  This is a revised 
        version of the August 2012 map layer.

      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

    Native_Data_Set_Environment: 
      Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise Version 6.1.7601 (Build 7601); ESRI ArcGIS 10.0.5.4400
  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        All attributes were checked to make sure their values are in the correct domains.  No null (blank) 
        values are present except in the Name attribute.

        The Stream_ID was checked for duplicates and nulls.  All features have a unique Stream_ID.

        Names were checked for invalid characters and foreign characters.  Streams with no name available 
        have a null value.

        Selections by attribute and location were used to ensure the Region code matches the region the 
        stream is in.

        Length was calculated using the North America Albers Equal Area Conic projection.  Features have 
        been generalized so the length of a stream may be different from a measurement in a larger-scale 
        data set.

    Logical_Consistency_Report: 
      Streams were checked for topological consistency using ArcGIS, to ensure there were no overlapping, 
      intersecting, or multi-part features.  ArcGIS topological checks were also used to verify correct 
      spatial relationships between streams and county, State, and national boundaries.  Streams were 
      checked at coastlines to ensure their endpoints intersected the coastline.  Selections by attribute 
      and location were used to verify feature types based on their relationship to waterbodies.  A 
      geometric network of streams was built and connectivity was checked through upstream and downstream 
      traces.  
    Completeness_Report: 
      This map layer contains streams of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Only 
      streams appropriate for a 1:1,000,000-scale data set are included.   Preference was given to natural 
      waterways, although a limited number of canals and aqueducts are included.  Boundaries for the map 
      layer are generally the 1:1,000,000-scale national boundaries and coastlines. The Intracoastal 
      Waterway is the exception to this, in that it is outside the coastline.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
          Streams in the 48 conterminous states and Hawaii are in approximately the same locations as in 
          the Medium-Resolution National Hydrography Dataset NHDFlowline feature class used as a source. 
          Streams in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are in approximately the same 
          locations as in the High-Resolution National Hydrography Dataset NHDFlowline feature class used 
          as a source.  However, many processes and editing tasks resulted in the movement of streams from 
          their original positions, including: extending or trimming streams to intersect the coastline or 
          international boundaries; moving streams to follow county, State, and international boundaries 
          where  the boundary is coincident with the stream; moving streams 300 meters from transportation 
          features if the two were parallel; increasing the gap between headwater streams in neighboring 
          watersheds; adjusting streams to their proper route through waterbodies; splitting streams at 
          waterbody boundaries; snapping streams to streams in neighboring hydrologic subregions and 
          regions; moving streams to ensure network connectivity; and moving streams to match imagery.

          Feature Selection

          The Medium-Resolution NHDFlowline data served as the primary source data for streams in the 48 
          conterminous States and Hawaii.  The High-Resolution NHDFlowline data served as the primary 
          source data for streams in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Headwater streams 
          in these two sources were selected if the same headwater was present in National Atlas 
          Streams 1:2M, VMAP0 Streams 1:1M, or the IMW 1:1M. 

          The downstream trace tool, a custom tool developed specifically for this project, uses ArcObjects 
          to apply an algorithm to the indicated headwater streams to determine the preferred downstream 
          route on the NHD geometric network.  The tool analyzes the stream name, flow direction, and 
          feature type (for example, stream, canal, or artificial path.)  If there was only one downstream 
          segment, it was included in the map layer.  If there was more than one downstream segment, a set 
          of criteria was used to decide which of the downstream segments should be included in the map 
          layer.  Priority was given to named segments, segments coded as streams, and segments with flow 
          direction.  If a downstream segment could not be identified with the trace tool, a segment was 
          selected manually using EDNA Flow Accumulation data and USGS DOQQs to support decisions.  

          After all possible streams were selected, the network was examined for connectivity.  
          Connectivity was checked visually and by tracing upstream on the proposed 1:1,000,000-scale 
          (1:1M) network.

          Cartographic Generalization

          All streams selected in the feature-selection process were exported as a new feature class, and 
          then simplified using the Bend Simplify algorithm with a tolerance of 500 meters.  The feature 
          class was further simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm with a 1-meter tolerance to 
          remove any extraneous vertices.  The new, simplified and generalized data set was then tested for 
          network connectivity.  A new regional geometric network was created, and upstream traces were 
          used to search for missing or disconnected streams.

          The simplified streams were snapped to National Atlas Coastline 1:1M.  Streams along the 
          terrestrial international boundaries were snapped to the National Atlas National Boundaries 1:1M.  
          Streams that form part of the international boundary were aligned with the boundary so that the 
          two features are coincident.   The data were checked for topological consistency using ArcGIS, to 
          ensure that streams terminated at the coastline or terrestrial international boundary or were 
          aligned with the international boundary.

          In the 48 conterminous States and Hawaii, the ReachCode and ComID were imported from 
          Medium-Resolution NHDFlowline.  In Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the 
          ReachCode and ComID were imported from High-Resolution NHDFlowline.  In cases where streams were 
          added manually and where no ReachCode or ComID was available, a value of -999 was entered.

          The name of the stream generally comes from the GNIS_Name attribute in Medium-Resolution 
          NHDFlowline or High-Resolution NHDFlowline.  Streams without a GNIS name were named if their 
          upstream and downstream neighbors had the same name.  Additional streams were named manually 
          based on stream names in other small-, medium-, and large-scale maps.

          Correction of Stream Density Disparities

          Selecting headwaters based on streams in the IMW map sheets created stream density disparities at 
          the borders of the IMW sheets.  Streams were deleted in the densest regions to create a more 
          uniform level of density.  Criteria for deletion included the type of stream, name attributes, 
          and the length to confluence.

          Construction of a National Geometric Network of Streams

          A geometric network was created for the streams.  The direction of flow is the same as the 
          direction in which the streams are digitized.  The network was traced upstream to check 
          connectivity.  Disconnected segments were connected and line directions were reversed when 
          necessary.  Initially all features were enabled as part of the network.  Some features were 
          disabled because they are offshore, have indeterminate flow, have locks, or otherwise prevented 
          the network from tracing upstream or downstream properly.  The majority of disabled segments are 
          either the Intracoastal Waterway or canals.  NHDPlus V1 NHDFlowline, High-Resolution NHDFlowline, 
          imagery, and topographic maps were used to guide editing in places where connectivity or flow 
          direction was unclear.

          The Enabled attribute exists for geometric networking purposes.  The values are 1 for true 
          (enabled) and 0 for false (disabled).  The calculation of the Enabled attribute was done 
          concurrently with the construction and verification of the geometric network (described 
          above.)  Initially all features were enabled.  Some features were disabled because they are 
          offshore, have indeterminate flow, or have locks.  Other segments that prevented the network from 
          tracing upstream or downstream properly were disabled.

          Calculation of Feature Types 

          The Feature attribute describes the type of linear water feature.  With the exception of 
          Artificial Path, the set of feature types comes from the National Atlas Streams 1:2M map layer.  
          The feature attribute was initially calculated based on the National Hydrography Dataset 
          NHDFlowline FCode using the following crosswalk:
          >Aqueduct: NHD FCode starts with 428
          >Canal: NHD FCode starts with 336
          >Intracoastal Waterway: Coded manually
          >Stream: NHD FCode is 46006 or 46000
          >Stream Intermittent: NHD FCode is 46003
          >Artificial Path: NHD FCode starts with 558 or 334
          >
          
          Since the waterbodies in the 1:1M data are not identical to the waterbodies in the source NHD 
          data, the Artificial Paths had to be recalculated based on their spatial relationship with 1:1M 
          waterbodies.  Stream segments were split at the limits of waterbodies, except for swamps/marshes.  
          Segments inside the waterbody were given the value Artificial Path.  Segments outside the 
          waterbody were coded as Stream, Stream Intermittent, or Canal based on the values of neighboring 
          segments.  Streams inside glaciers were removed.  Imagery and topographic maps were used to guide 
          decisions.

          >Stream, Stream Intermittent, Artificial Path: GM_f_code = BH140

          GM_hyc was calculated using the following crosswalk:

          GM_nam was calculated from the Name attribute.  If the name is null (blank) then the GM_nam is 
          UNK.  Aqueduct, Canal, and Intracoastal Waterway were given the value of -999 (GM_nam not

          Streams that intersect or follow the United States-Canada border were aligned with Canadian 
          streams at the border in order to facilitate seamless cross-border mapping.  This was a 
          back-and-forth process in which each country reviewed the other's border streams, made 
          adjustments to their own streams, proposed changes for streams in the other country, and acted on 
          proposals for changes in their own country.  Types of modifications included snapping ends of 
          streams to each other at the border, reshaping streams near the border, creating greater 
          separation between headwaters that begin near the border, adding streams if the corresponding 
          stream exists in the other data set, and deleting streams if no corresponding stream exists in 
          the other data set.

          Update of Names and Reach Codes

          Stream names and reach codes were initially determined in 2007 but had to be updated to match the 
          Medium-Resolution Flowline, High Resolution NHDFlowline, and NHDPlus V2 NHDFlowline, all of which 
          have incorporated changes to names and reach codes since the creation of version 1 of the 
          National Atlas Streams 1:1M.  The ComID was used to link the streams with different resolutions 
          and versions of NHD and NHDPlus.  NHD has switched from using the ComID to using a 
          Permanent_Identifier, but in most cases the value is the same as the former ComID. 

          Streams in the conterminous States (Hydrologic Regions 1 through 18) were joined by ComID with 
          the NHDFlowline feature class in NHDPlus V2 NHDFlowline, and the GNIS_Name and ReachCode from 
          that source were transferred to the stream Name and ReachCode fields.  If there was no 
          corresponding ComID, then the stream retained its original Name and ReachCode.  

          Streams in Alaska and Puerto Rico (Hydrologic Regions 19 and 21) were joined by ComID and 
          Permanent Identifier with the NHDFlowline feature class in High-Resolution NHDFlowline and the 
          GNIS_Name and ReachCode from that source were transferred to the stream Name and ReachCode 
          fields.  If there was no corresponding Permanent_Identifier, then the stream retained its 
          original Name and ReachCode.  

          Streams in Hawaii (Hydrologic Region 20) were joined by ComID with the NHDFlowline feature class 
          in Medium-Resolution NHDFlowline and the GNIS_Name from that source was transferred to the 
          streams.  ReachCodes were identical for streams and the NHDFlowlines in Medium-Resolution 
          NHDFlowline.  No comparison could be made between High-Resolution NHDFlowline in Hawaii and the 
          streams because they do not share the same ComIDs or Permanent_Identifiers.

          In all regions, in cases where streams were added manually and where no reach code or ComID was 
          available, a value of -999 was entered for the ReachCode.

          The Strahler stream order attribute was initially calculated in 2012 for the release of the 
          Version 1 streams.  It was updated in 2014 for diversions, international border streams, and the 
          Intracoastal Waterway.  In border areas, it was modified to reflect the stream order of streams 
          entering the United States from Canada and Mexico. For smaller international stream networks the 
          stream order was calculated. For larger international stream networks the editors made a rough 
          estimate.  The stream order of diversions was reduced to 1.  Streams that are disabled were not 
          included in the stream order calculation.  They have a Strahler value of -999 if they are inside 
          the coastline.  The stream order of the portions of the Intracoastal Waterway that are outside 
          the coastline was set to -998 in order to aid in symbolizing streams in cartographic 
          products.

          M-values were calculated for each reach using the NHD MValue Utility.  M-values range from 0 
          to 100 and measure the distance of each vertex along a line.  In this map layer, m-values 
          describe the distance, as a percentage, from the downstream end of the reach.  If a reach is 
          composed of more than one stream segment, the range of 0 to 100 is not repeated on each segment 
          but spread over the length of the entire group of segments that comprise the reach.  M-values are 
          stored in the m-coordinate of each vertex and are used in linear referencing.
