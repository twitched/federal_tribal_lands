    Description:
      Abstract: 
        This geodatabase contains streams, waterbodies and wetlands, streamflow gaging stations, and 
        coastlines for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The streams are 
        incorporated into a geometric network.  All feature classes are vertically integrated with each 
        other and with 1:1,000,000-scale transportation and boundary data sets.
      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

          Creation of the Geometric Network

          A geometric network was created from the streams.  The network uses the Enabled attribute; all 
          streams with an Enabled value of 1 (EnabledDomain value of True) participate in the network.  
          Flow direction was established using the digitized direction of the streams.

      Entity_and_Attribute_Overview: 
        The feature classes and their associated attributes describe hydrographic features in the United 
        States, including streams, waterbodies and wetlands, streamflow gaging stations, coastlines, and 
        the hydrography network.  Each feature class is a single entity and has at least one attribute. 
      Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: 
        Full descriptions of attributes, attribute values, and compilation methods for the streams, 
        waterbodies and wetlands, streamflow gaging stations, and coastlines are available in their 
        respective national metadata records, which are included in the downloadable file with the 
        geodatabase.
